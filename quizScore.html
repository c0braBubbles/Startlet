            The difference between some of the best CEOs and the mediocre ones are not necessarily that they 
            do different activities, but rather they do them in different proportions. Startup CEOs can spend 
            around 40% of their working hours on tasks that do not generate income such as hiring, HR tasks, 
            and payroll. Read more at <a href="https://blog.cardash.com/how-startup-ceos-spend-their-time-769148c1a705">cardash.com</a> the blog.

            Two founders increase the odds of a startup’s success with 30% more investment, three times the 
            customer growth rate, and a higher likelihood the startup will not scale too fast. VCs don’t fund 
            sole founders and, if you are alone, you’ve either got too much ego or you can’t convince someone 
            to join you. Decisions need to be made fast in startups and you have to ensure you can have a tie-breaker.

            age is 40, and younger founders aren’t uncommon. However, young people are less common in other industries

            Every startup should start with building a Minimum viable product (MVP), and use it to validate their 
            hypotheses about customer needs. An MVP can be simply a landing page, a mockup by Adobe XD or a simple 
            mobile app with a single feature. MVP is created for multiple purposes, including communication and fund 
            raising. MVP focuses on speed, but it does not mean ignoring key quality attribute and throwing garbage to 
            customers. Read more at <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-33515-5_10">Springer Link</a>

            A lot of successful startups launched with a different business model, and when they ran into 
            trouble they pivoted to something new. A pivot is a shift in business strategy to test a new 
            approach or product after receiving market feedback. There are different types of pivot according 
            to changing product or market factors. Read more at <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1710/1710.04037.pdf">arxiv.org</a>

        <br>

        <p class="awnserTxt">
            Technical debt describes a situation that developers sometimes produce a quick solution to an issue 
            or a feature to meet an urgent demand in some other aspects (e.g., a deadline), and that leads to a 
            “debt” on which “interest” has to be paid and which the “principal” should be repaid at some point for 
            the long-term health of the project. Technical debt is not necessarily a bad thing, and sometimes 
            (e.g., as a proof-of-concept) is required to move projects forward. In startup context, team competence, 
            focusing on speed and lack of sufficient debt management can lead to a negative impact of technical debts.

        <br>

        <p class="awnserTxt">
            Ad-based revenue model entails creating ads for a specific website or product and placing them on 
            your high-traffic websites or apps. In order to generate sufficient revenue to withhold a business, 
            you will need to attract millions of users. In addition, most people find ads annoying, which can lead 
            to low clickthrough rates, and therefore, lower revenue. In a transactional revenue model, consumers
            are more attracted to this experience because of its simplicity and the wider set of options. However, 
            many companies can employ this model, which leads to a price competition. The subscription model can 
            generate recurring revenue, and can even benefit from customers who are simply too lazy to cancel their 
            subscription to your company. However, it’s critical to maintain a higher subscribe rate than an unsubscribe 
            rate. The freemium model is one in which a company’s basic services are free, yet users must pay for additional 
            premium features, extensions, functions, etc. One of the biggest companies to use this model is Linkedin, the 
            most popular business/social media platform. Read more at <a href="https://fi.co/insight/the-10-most-popular-startup-revenue-models">"Founder Institute"</a>
